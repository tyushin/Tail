Password authentication doesn’t scale well.
The more services we use, the more passwords we’re forced to remember.
In the name of security, SaaS applications,
social networks and other services enforce strict password rules that prevent honest people from signing in.
Username/password authentication is apparently so effective that it’s a serious barrier to product and service use.
It’s not the passwords themselves;
the problem is the scale at which people have to manage and remember usernames and passwords. It’s too much.
We don’t want to make our products less secure by relaxing our password standards,
so what are our real options to safely and securely authenticate people and protect their sensitive information?
There are a handful of ways today, and there are more coming.
There are even things we can do to make traditional password authentication frictionless and user-friendly.
Here are the options we realistically have today.
